# Given a positive integer millis, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for millis milliseconds. It can resolve any value.

Note that minor deviation from millis in the actual sleep duration is acceptable.

Example 1:

Input: millis = 100
Output: 100
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 100ms.
let t = Date.now();
sleep(100).then(() => {
console.log(Date.now() - t); // 100
});
Example 2:

Input: millis = 200
Output: 200
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 200ms.

Constraints:

1 <= millis <= 1000

## Hints

Hint 1
In Javascript, you can execute code after some delay with the setTimeout(fn, sleepTime) function.

Hint 2
An async function is defined as function which returns a Promise.

Hint 3
To create a Promise, you can code new Promise((resolve, reject) => {}). When you want the function to return a value, code resolve(value) inside the callback.
