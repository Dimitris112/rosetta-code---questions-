# Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

## Hints

Hint 1

In-place means we should not be allocating any space for extra array. But we are allowed to modify the existing array. However, as a first step, try coming up with a solution that makes use of additional space. For this problem as well, first apply the idea discussed using an additional array and the in-place solution will pop up eventually.

Hint 2

A two-pointer approach could be helpful here. The idea would be to have one pointer for iterating the array and another pointer that just works on the non-zero elements of the array.
